 ## Project Summary

 The Aloha Homepage Project tasked us with developing a homepage for our client, 
 Aloha Apparel Co. Part 1 of the project focused on building out the HTML and CSS
 components of this responsive website.

 ## Technology
 
 HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, Terminal/Command Line

 ## Personal Learning

 The objective learnings of this project were simply HTML and CSS. As these skills became
 familiar I began to understand the interworkings of the code including semantics,
 inheritance, specificity. By the end of the project I was manipulating the theoretical to
 aid my code's efficiency. 

 For example, getting the social media icons and their corresponding text inline was a
 major pain because of inheritance. The text was not inline because it was inheriting 
 a "text-align: center" tag from my defined "li" element. To fix this I removed the tag
 from "li", adding it to my "body" element so the "li" that needed the "text-align" would 
 inherit it, then I aligned the social media names with a "text-align" in the class I 
 defined for them. This is a demonstration of, not only inheritance, specificity too!

 Project Summary

 The Aloha Homepage Project tasked us with developing a homepage for our client,
 Aloha Apparel Co. Part 2 of the project focused on building upon our HTML and CSS, starting
 with a Mobile-First foundation. Our main goal was to build a responsive website, from mobile,
 to tablet, to desktop. Also, implementing Javascript components to make it look purdy.

 Technology

 Flickity, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, Terminal/Command Line

 Personal Learning

 The objective learnings of this project were geared towards a mobile-first approach meanwhile
 implementing Javascript components. From desktop to mobile-first, then back again, was not a
 minor task, but beneficial nonetheless. Having a compartmental foundation was incredible
 beneficial especially when we were pushed to remove floats from the first part of our project
 and implement the flexbox technique.

 For example, building a responsive header was a major hurdle. Manipulating both text and images
 using floats would have been nigh impossible to do. Instead, having the three components, logo,
 navigation bar, and cart icon, in compartments made it (relatively) easy.

Improvements

This project I fell short on major requirements. I struggled with implementing javascript when I
felt I should have been able. Furthermore, there were stylistic components that I missed
including text-styling, banner-heights, and ill-conceived white space. Although I was proud of
my footer and header, I fell short on the content in between, especially with implementing
smooth scrolling, consistent section heights, and fundamental components such as browser
compatibilities and website accessibility.

I swear my Subscribe button has a mind of its own. My worst enemy, I had it, then I didn't, then
had it again, then not. Halp me pls1!!!!!!!
